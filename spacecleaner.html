	Space Cleaner: The Game
	</h1>
	<p>
	It is the year 2167 and Earth is no longer habitable so people must now travel to Mars to start a new life. 
	You are employed to scout the path to Mars and make sure that there is no Space Trash or else they might crash into
	the main spaceship and kill everyone onboard. So you take your good ole spaceship Fred along for a joyride to shoot at 
	the Trash accumulations. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>
	Setting up the Game
	</h2>
	<p>
	When you click the run button, you will see the display screen pop up. It will be your spaceship Fred and numerous stars flickering 
	around the screen. Don't worry, the stars are purely cosmetic (hehe pun intended)! 
	</p>
	<p>
	Go to the webpage <a href="http://127.0.0.1:10002/">127.0.0.1:10002/<a/> to see all the possible controls. There will be
	3 buttons, 3 radios, 1 slider, and 2 monitors. The monitor "Health" tells you the health of Spaceship Fred and the monitor "Score"
	tells you how many Space Trash Accumulations you've destroyed so far.
	</p>
	<p>
	You can change how often the Space Trash spawns by changing the "Spawn Frequency" radio. "Occasional" will spawn a new Space Trash
	every 8 seconds, "Normal" will spawn one every 7 seconds, and "Frequent" will spawn one every 6 seconds.
	</p>
	<p>
	Next is the "Accumulation Speed" which determines how fast these Space Trash clusters grow. The more that they grow, the higher their
	health is. "Slow" increases the size every 3 seconds, "Normal" increases the size every 2 seconds, and "Fast" increases it every second.
	</P>
	<p>
	The "Accumulation Growth" slider is pretty self explanatory. By adjusting the slider, you control by what percentage the Space Trash 
	grows every time it grows. 
	</p>
	
	<h2>
	Playing the Game
	</h2>
	<p>
	Now that you've got everything set up, it's time to play this game. You can change the settings from "Setting up the Game" at any point in time. 
	Press the "Start" button and press onto the display screen. You are now able to control how Fred moves. Fred is very special because you can 
	control it with either "WASD" or the arrow buttons. Is Fred about to go off the screen? Don't worry! It will come back on the other end of the screen. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Every 1.5 seconds, Fred will shoot a bullet and if it hits a Space Trash clump, it will reduce its radius and its health. If the Space Trash is red,
	it will disappear and your score will increase. Fred is very unique because it can shoot from any of it's 3 cannons. You can choose which gun it shoots 
	from by choosing in the "Choose a Gun" radio. The point of this game is to earn the highest score possible. Make sure that Fred does not bump into
	the Space Trash or else its health will drop. If it drops to 0, the game is over. At any point in the game, you may pause it or restart.
